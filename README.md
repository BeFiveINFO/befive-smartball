# BeFive Smartball

BeFive Smartball is

- An HTML5 game that needs to be on web server.
- Written in Javascript
- Using primarily [Oimo.js](https://github.com/lo-th/Oimo.js/) engine library and [Three.JS](https://threejs.org/) 3D rendering engine library.

## Demo

### Please visit [Befive Smartball](http://play.befive.info/smartball/) online site to see how it works.

## Getting Started & Installing

Download as zip archive and throw thawed directory onto your web server. (Or clone directly). Load the directory in your browser. Have fun.

The game works without being installed on a web server but images / sound files would not be loaded in web browsers because of CORS.

### Prerequisites

Web server of your own. And any browsers that support HTML5 and WebGL.

## Built With

* [Oimo.js](https://github.com/lo-th/Oimo.js/)
* [Three.JS](https://threejs.org/)
* [SoundJS](http://www.createjs.com/soundjs)

## Contributing

Please fork or download, modify and make it your own. Sorry for the messy code but I will not be able to give much support.

The code begins with *PCB.boot.init()* in the *scripts/PCB/boot.js* where you can start tracing the code.
